- Added proper class management for zoom states

**Key Files Modified**: `index.html`, `js/game.js`

---

### 8. Full Size View and Touch Controls Fix

**Prompt**: "great work. can you make Full Size View to use 90% of height, and make it default. Also, the on screen controls are not showing up."

**Actions Taken**:

- Set xlarge (Full Size View) as default zoom level
- Fixed touch controls visibility logic with improved menu state detection
- Added null checks for all UI elements in visibility function
- Enhanced debug logging for touch controls troubleshooting
- Updated zoom level names to reflect new sizing approach

**Key Files Modified**: `index.html`, `js/game.js`

---

### 9. Complete Sizing Overhaul

**Prompt**: "the spacing is still not good. the startup is not on full size. also, on larger monitors i see a lot of empty space around. Please do calculations of size again when on screen controls toggle."

**Actions Taken**:
- Implemented full screen utilization (100vw × 100vh) for game container
- Created dynamic height adjustment system for touch controls visibility
- Added CSS classes: `.touch-controls-visible` and `.touch-controls-hidden`

**Key Files Modified**: `index.html`

---

### 10. Canvas Sizing Fix

**Prompt**: "the container seem to be relative to the screen, but the canvas is still small."

**Actions Taken**:
- Changed from container scaling to canvas percentage-based sizing
- Implemented canvas sizing as percentage of container (60%, 75%, 90%, 100%)

**Key Files Modified**: `index.html`, `js/game.js`

---

### 11. CSS Review and Alignment Fix

**Prompt**: "ok so the container seems to be fixed around the edge of the browser. The canvas has dead green bands on both sides. The only good thing is the maximum zoom, made canvas use 90% of shortest side, height in my case. Please align them. Review all css."

**Actions Taken**:
- Implemented smart aspect ratio calculations using `min()` function
- Fixed canvas centering with proper 4:3 aspect ratio maintenance
- Added black background container with proper padding

- Improved UI panel styling with backdrop blur

**Key Files Modified**: `index.html`, `js/game.js`

---

### 12. Visual Clutter Cleanup

**Prompt**: "ok canvas is behaving as expected, but the container around it is still there. I see one outer green rectangle around the edge of browser, one green around the canvas, and even one around HUD, which is fixed at the top right corner of screen, instead of moving with canvas. Also, at startup I see game over popup at bottom."

**Actions Taken**:
- Removed outer green border from body/container
- Removed green border from HUD panel
- Fixed game over popup by adding explicit `style="display: none"`
- Removed conflicting body flexbox centering
- Set body background to pure black (#000)

- Made HUD scale and move with canvas at all zoom levels

**Key Files Modified**: `index.html`

---

### 14. Leaderboard Cleanup
